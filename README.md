# FSLS 2021 proeject - E2E classification of brain tumor's subtypes

-----
This project aims to create an end-to-end webapp for the classification of bran tumor's subtypes.
Where after an initial unsupervised 
Project for the FSDL course to build a webapp for cancer subtype clusterting and prediction


## Outcome

The final outcome of this project is a Webapp, where a user can upload their transcriptomic data and their sample will be classify in one of the previous discovered subtypes.
In addition, information about the distance to the other subtypes and general information about them will also be provided.

## Data type and sources

At the beginning only transcriptomic data (RNAseq), if possible add additional types of data such as microRNA, clinical and other.

### Sources

- The Cancer Genome Atlas Program - TCGA: Over 20,000 samples of cancer with genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.
- The Genotype-Tissue Expression - GTEx: Over 1,000 non-disease samples with gene expression and regulation data.
